# Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to my repository for reinforcement learning projects and homework! This repository is a dedicated space for exploring various reinforcement learning techniques using Python, featuring implementations and experiments on the following key topics:

- **Highway Environment with DQN (Deep Q-Network):** Dive into the world of deep reinforcement learning by training agents to navigate the complexities of a highway environment. Experience how Deep Q-Networks enable agents to make optimal decisions in high-dimensional state spaces.

- **Win-Stay Lose-Shift Multi-Armed Bandit:** Understand the fundamentals of multi-armed bandit problems, where agents need to balance exploration and exploitation to maximize rewards. Explore the Win-Stay Lose-Shift strategy and its applications.

- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** Learn about the mathematical framework underlying reinforcement learning with Markov Decision Processes. Explore the principles of state, action, transition probabilities, and rewards in sequential decision-making tasks.

- **Q-Learning:** Delve into the world of Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that uses Q-tables to guide agents in making optimal decisions, suitable for various environments.

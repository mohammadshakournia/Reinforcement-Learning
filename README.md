# Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to my repository for reinforcement learning homework and projects! This space is dedicated to showcasing my exploration of reinforcement learning techniques using Python.

## About Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a fascinating subfield of machine learning that focuses on training intelligent agents to make sequential decisions. These agents learn from their interactions with an environment, aiming to maximize a cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning has found applications in various domains, including robotics, game playing, autonomous systems, and more.

## Repository Contents

This repository houses a collection of my reinforcement learning assignments, projects, and experiments, covering a wide range of topics and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- **Q-Learning:** Explore the fundamentals of Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that uses a Q-table to guide decision-making.

- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Discover the power of neural networks in reinforcement learning with Deep Q-Networks, which enable the handling of complex, high-dimensional state spaces.

- **Policy Gradients:** Dive into policy-based methods, where the agent directly learns a policy to maximize its expected rewards.

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO):** Investigate advanced reinforcement learning techniques, such as Proximal Policy Optimization, which addresses issues like policy updates and exploration.

- **Actor-Critic:** Understand the Actor-Critic architecture, combining policy-based and value-based methods to achieve more stable learning.

## Projects and Homework

Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on as part of coursework, self-study, or personal research. These projects range from simple implementations to more complex simulations and real-world applications. Each project comes with detailed documentation and code for you to explore, learn from, and build upon.

## Getting Started

To get started with my reinforcement learning projects, simply:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific project or homework folder you're interested in.
3. Follow the project-specific README and instructions to run and experiment with the code.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to any project, provide feedback, or suggest improvements, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I welcome collaboration and learning from fellow reinforcement learning enthusiasts.
